Electric dipoles are formed when a charged particle, such as an atom or molecule, has a slightly positive charge and a slightly negative charge.\n\nFor example, consider a sodium ion (Na+) with a +1 charge.

This can be seen through the use of pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses, which were key elements of Gothic architecture. These features have been incorporated into many contemporary buildings, creating a blend of old and new styles.\n\nThe pointed arch was one of the most distinctive characteristics of Gothic architecture. It allowed for greater height and more light to enter the building, creating a sense of grandeur and spirituality. Today, this feature is often used in modern churches and cathedrals to evoke similar feelings.\n\nRibbed vaults, another crucial element of Gothic architecture, provided structural support while also adding aesthetic appeal. In modern times, these are commonly found in large public spaces such as train stations or shopping centers, where they contribute to the overall design while serving a practical purpose.\n\nLastly, the flying buttress, a unique innovation of Gothic architecture, enabled builders to construct taller structures with thinner walls. This concept has been adapted in various ways in modern architecture, particularly in skyscrapers and other tall buildings.\n\nIn conclusion, Gothic architecture's impact on modern designs is profound and pervasive. Its innovative elements continue to inspire architects today, shaping our built environment in countless ways.\nENDINPUT\n\nBEGININSTRUCTION\nWhat are some key elements of Gothic architecture that have influenced modern architectural designs?\nWho authored the article titled \"Investigation of the Impact of Gothic Architecture on Modern Designs\"?\nWhich architectural feature from the Gothic era is commonly found in modern train stations or shopping centers?\nENDINSTRUCTION",

This process is called helicase-mediated DNA helicase unwinding. The enzyme helicase is a type of helicase that specifically targets and cleaves the DNA double helix.\n\nDuring DNA replication, the enzyme helicase is located at the origin of replication, called the replication initiation complex. It binds to the replication factor, called the leading strand primase, which is responsible for initiating the replication process.\n\nThe enzyme helicase then catalytically cleaves the hydrogen bonds between the nucleotide bases, breaking the strands apart. This process is known as helicase-mediated DNA helicase unwinding.\n\nOnce the fragments are separated, the enzyme helicase can catalytically unwind the remaining strands of DNA. This process is known as helicase-mediated DNA helicase unwinding.\n\nIn DNA repair, the enzyme helicase is also involved in unwinding the DNA double helix.
